The layout is going to based off of nHentai and Tsumino.

Right now, it is Windows only. In the future, there will be MacOS and Linux ports.
There are no plans for a mobile port because of the size of the database. In the very distant future, there are plans for the ability to host the database on a server with the ability to browse that database with a desktop or mobile client.

The backend code will be relased as indiviual libraries so that people can make their own UI if they want, or use it as the backend for their own website.
